# Learn command line

Please follow and complete the free online [Command Line Crash Course
tutorial](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/). This is a great,
quick tutorial. Each "chapter" focuses on a command. Type the commands
you see in the _Do This_ section, and read the _You Learned This_
section. Move on to the next chapter. You should be able to go through
these in a couple of hours.

###Q1.  Cheat Sheet of Commands  

Make a cheat sheet for yourself: a list of at least **ten** commands and what they do, focused on things that are new, interesting, or otherwise worth remembering.

> > `pushd`, which lets me move to a new directory while "pushing" (saving) my current directory for later 
`popd`, which lets me "pop" back to the last directory I pushed
`more`, which lets me view a file in the terminal
`|` for "piping" the output of one command into another command. I used pipes a lot in R so I was happy to discover this. 
`find . -name "*.txt" -print` for ways to find files with certain types of names
`man` for being possibly the most useful function because it provides me with information about other commands (although I also use Stack Overflow a lot)
`grep`, which can search for words in a file
`cp`, which takes a file and copies it into a new one
`cat`, which investigates the content of a file
`say`, which reads out words
