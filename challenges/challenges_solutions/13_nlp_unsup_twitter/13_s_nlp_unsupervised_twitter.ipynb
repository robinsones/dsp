    "Let's name the clusters 1 For each cluster, find the sentence closest to the centroid of the cluster. (You can use sklearn.metrics.pairwise_distances7 or scipy.spatial.distance4 [check pdist, cdist, and euclidean distance] to find distances to the centroid). KMeans has a cluster_centroids_ attribute. This sentence (closest to centroid) is now the name of the cluster. For each cluster, print the representative sentence, and print 'N people expressed a similar statement', or something like that relevant to your dataset. (This is very close to what amazon used to do in the reviews section up to a year ago.)\n",

(This is close to what amazon switched to last year, before settling into the current design).

    "Cluster the same data with MiniBatchKMeans4. MiniBatchKMeans is a fast way to apply K-means to large data without much loss -- The results are very similar. Instead of using EVERY single point to find the new place of the centroid, MiniBatch just randomly samples a small number (like 100) in the cluster to calculate the new center. Since this is usually very close to the actual center, the algorithm gets there much faster. Try it and compare the results. Example on two-feature data5\n",
