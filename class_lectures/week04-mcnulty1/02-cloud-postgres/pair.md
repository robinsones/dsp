#### Pair Problem

Generating [Fibonacci numbers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) is a classic programming exercise.

Each Fibonacci number is the sum of the two previous. Starting with 1 and 2, we have `fib(1) == 1`, `fib(2) == 1`, `fib(3) == 2`, `fib(4) == 3`, `fib(5) == 5`, and `fib(6) == 8`. A little further on, `fib(12) == 144`.

Write a function definition skeleton with _doctests_ that cover all the examples given above. Run the doctests to confirm that your tests fail.

Fill in the function definition to calculate Fibonacci numbers. Run your doctests to confirm that the tests pass.

If you have time, think about edge cases, and try to make your implementation more efficient.
