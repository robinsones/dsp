#### Pair Problem

This is a classic problem. This particular wording is taken from [Cracking the Coding Interview](http://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X) (question 9.8):

> Given an infinite number of quarters (25 cents), dimes (10 cents), nickels (5 cents) and pennies (1 cent), write code to calculate the number of ways of representing n cents.

The problem is started for you here, so you can just complete the following function definition:

```python
def ways(cents, coins=[25, 10, 5, 1]):
    """Return the number of ways to make change.

    >>> ways(100)
    242
    """
    raise NotImplementedError
```

Suggestion: Think about simpler cases first, and feel free to add more doctests!
