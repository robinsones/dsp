#### Pair Problem

Write a JavaScript function that works like a counter:

```javascript
count();
// 1
count();
// 2
count();
// 3
```

The added wrinkle is that you aren't allowed to have any other variables accessible globally.

Once you have something working in JavaScript, do the same thing in Python:

```python
count()
## 1
count()
## 2
count()
## 3
```
