#### Pair Problem

# Part 1
Write a function called distance that takes two numpy arrays as inputs and returns a numpy array of the euclidean distance between the two. This should work for multidimensional arrays.
For example, if arr1 = np.array([[1,2,3], [4,5,6]]) and arr2 = np.array([[6,7,8], [2,5,7]]) the output should be a 2x2 numpy array of the distances between the vectors in arr1 and arr2.


# Part 2
* Create a folder (d3_project)
* Make an HTML file.
* With a heading.
* And a paragraph.
* Create a CSS file and use it to change the appearance of something.
* Create a folder in your project folder called d3 
* Download d3 and put the d3.js or d3.min.js file in the d3 folder. [Download here](https://d3js.org/)
