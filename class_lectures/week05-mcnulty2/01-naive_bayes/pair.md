#### Pair Problem

**Does it make a difference (to performance) whether you pop from the front or the back of a Python list?**

Should it matter? Why would it? Why wouldn't it?

Devise and carry out at least one experiment to check.

What do you conclude?

Make a graph to show your results as a function of list size.

What other interesting performance comparisons can you find?
