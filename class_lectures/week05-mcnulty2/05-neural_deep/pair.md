AS PROMISED, MORE SQL!   

Again, we will be working from the Lahman Baseball data
that we uploaded to your cloud. 


1) What was the total spent on salaries by each team, each year?


2) What is the first and last year played for each player?     
(hint: Create new table from the 'Fielding.csv')

3) Who has played the most all star games?


4) Which school has generated the most distinct players?     
(hint: Create new table from the 'SchoolsPlayers.csv')


* You can try to do this via SQLAlchemy & Ipynb.
