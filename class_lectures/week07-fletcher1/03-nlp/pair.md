#### Pair Problem

names.csv has the unique names and gender from US births from the years 1940 to 1990.

* Open the pair.ipynb notebook and load in names.csv.
* Split into a train and test sets
* Build a classifier to classify gender from only a name. The trick here is to engineer features from the names.
* What is your cross validation and test set performance?
* What features are important?
