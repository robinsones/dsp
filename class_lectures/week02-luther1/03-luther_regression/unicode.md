# Unicode: `¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø`


---

In the beginning, there was ASCII.

Everything was bytes starting with 0.

`01000001` was "A", and it was good.

In decimal "A" was 65, and it was good.

In hexadecimal "A" was 41, and it was good.

Every character was exactly one byte.

But humans yearned for more than 128 symbols.

And so there was the great confusion of tongues, with CP-1252 and its kin.

Character bytes could start with 1, giving 256 of them.

But not everyone agreed about what they should all mean.

There was much suffering.

---

Then there was Unicode.

Millions of code points arose to represent everything under the sun, including üëç.

There was still some confusion about how to represent all these symbols in computers.

But UTF-8 brought the wisdom of variable-byte encoding, and there was much rejoicing.
