#### Pair Problem

 1. In the game where you try to guess an integer and are told whether you're high or low, how many guesses do you need if the number is between 1 and 100? What if it's between 1 and 1,000? What if it's between 1 and 1,000,000? What if it's between 1 and *n*?
 2. If you have a sorted list of numbers, how can you find the number that is closest to 5 without checking every number? Write pseudo-code for an algorithm.
 3. If you have a list of a million sentences, some of which are identical, how can you find the duplicates without checking all the pairs of sentences?

If you resolve the three items above, implement #2 in running Python.
