#### Pair Problem

* Look up clustering in SciPy
* How would you perform hierarchical clustering? Draw a dendrogram?
* Grab a dataset or default to the newsgroup data in Sklearn
* Sample from this dataset and create a dendrogram
* Count and TFIDF vectorizer both return a scipy sparse matrix when transformed. If you didn't want to look at the whole matrix how would you get values for a particular row, observation?
