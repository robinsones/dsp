#### Pair Problem

You may be asked to write code that reads from _standard input_ and/or writes to _standard output_. For example, you will be asked to do that now.

Write a program that reads from standard input and writes each line reversed to standard output. For example, if your Python script is called "reverser.py", you could do this at a command line:

```bash
echo -e "first line\nsecond line" | python reverser.py
```

And the output should be:

```
enil tsrif
enil dnoces
```
