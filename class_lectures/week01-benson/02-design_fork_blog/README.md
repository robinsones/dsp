## Schedule

[A thought for the day](https://twitter.com/sanityinc/status/581079954307305472)

**9:00 am**: Good morning! :coffee:

**9:15 am**: [Pair Problem](pair.md)

**10:00 am**: [The iterative design process](Design_Process.pdf)

 * [Watch](https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/9059/101341) a webinar version of this talk delivered by Datascope data scientist Bo Peng.

**10:30 am**: [Brainstorming time](Brainstorming_Guidelines.md)

 * Brainstorm as a class
 * Brainstorm within your project group

**12:00 pm**: Lunch

**1:30 pm**: [Fork, Clone, Blog, Markdown](fork_clone_blog_markdown.md)

By the end of the day:

 * Have a problem statement for your Benson group submitted on Slack. Whether based on the original example client email or a variation, this should express the angle your group is working on. Think about how individual group members can all contribute.
 * Have your blog full personalized: remove or replace all the defaults and filler. You should also set up Google Analytics for your blog. Make sure all your information is complete in the class info and signup document.


### More resources

 * There are a lot of other [Jekyll themes](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/wiki/Themes) that you could use. (That's not the only list of themes either.)
 * Another blogging option is [Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/), which is written in Python and can be made to integrate nicely with Python Jupyter notebooks.
