### Synopsis:

Project Fletcher involves analyzing text data with one or more of Natural Language Processing techniques. It is a two week project, and students have the choice to make it the first step of their passion project (which will come to full fruition during Project Kojak).


-----


### How it works:

Students choose a question to answer related to natural language processing, and gather text data to this end. API sources are preferred but not enforced.

Techniques they learn and will apply include clustering algorithms, keyword extraction, topic models, approximate nearest neighbor algorithms and NoSQL databases.

The end deliverable will be either a blog post that communicates their findings or an interactive dashboard, depending on what fits the project best.


------


### Data:

While the data source is left to the choice of each student, there are two constraints:

 * The project must involve text data
 * Students should use mongoDB to store and query the data


-----


### Timeline:

 * ##### Week 7:
     * Design decisions, data collection and initial iterations

 * ##### Week 8:
     * Final analyses and visualization
     * On Friday, students share the links to their final output with each other
     * Students give each other feedback on the interface, results and communication clarity
