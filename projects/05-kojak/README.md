### Synopsis:

Project Kojak is the Passion Project, the final project where all
choices belong to each individual student. 

-----

### How it works:

Each student will have chosen an idea they are passionate about by the
time Kojak starts. They make all the choices, and work on it by
themselves (with guidance and help from instructors, of course.)

-----
