>> To give a bit of explanation for my McNulty project, I'm trying to predict which MLB players will get into the Hall of Fame on their first ballot.
I've first split the data into Pitchers vs. Hitters, 
and have tried working on hitters first using simply the most basic stats, career hits, games played, homeruns and RBI.
When fitting with different models, I always hit the same limit of accuracy, which is about 96%, which is pretty weak, since only
about 5% make it on their first ballot.
