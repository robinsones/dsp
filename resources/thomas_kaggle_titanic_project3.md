from **Thomas Reynaud** (Metis nyc16_ds6 Alum):

I just wanted to give you the link of my code for the kaggle titanic training competition.  I thinks it introduces a lot of things I wish I knew earlier during the bootcamp like:
* pandas
* gridsearch
* feature engineering
* how to deal with missing data 

I’m sure the new cohort could find that very useful when they will start to study the classification algorithms and work on Project 3.  There may be some improvements to do but it’s a good start imo. It’s Python 3!
